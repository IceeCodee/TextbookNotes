### Watching a Game: Offensive Score Sheets

![Court Division and Labels](https://github.com/IceeCodee/TextbookNotes/blob/main/Thinking_Basketball_Dean_Oliver/thinkingbasketballcourt.png)

Number at the start of the line is the number of point at the end of the possession. The team abbreviationg comes next. This is followed by a sequence of passes, dribbles (denoted superscript D) , rebounds (denoted superscript R), shots (subcscripts indicated where the ball was shot from note the figure above. misses are denoted - makes are denoted +).
* / passes cross court, if in superscript it means dribbles across halfcourt
* ++ denotes made shot on assist
* X missed foul shot
* \* made foul shot
* KICK kick ball
* F in subscript denotes a foul, often folled by jersey number of player who committed the foul and how many fouls they have at the time it was committed.
* underlined number illustrates that the person is posting up
* TIME denoted a timeout was called often followed by how many minutes left
* ROB in superscript means the rebound went out of bounds (somtimes the player who take it out of bounds is tracked with OB)
* TO denoted turnover
* STL denoted steal
* BP denoted bad pass
* KOB denoted knocked out of bounds
* TRVL denotes the player travled
* END followed by note of which quarter it is
* OF denoted iffensive foul
* LB stands for lost ball type of turnover
* TFOUL denoted technical foul
* BK denoted block
* S CK TO denoted shot clock violation (turnover)

![Here is an example of game scoring in the book](examplecharting.png)

The most absic thing to come out of a scoresheet is the concept of a possession. At the end of a gam each team has just about the same possessions (cumulative sum). High energy, run and gun teams have a high possession count at an upward of 100 while walk it up the court, slower teams have around 80.  A good way to approximate possessions: <br/>
$Poss = FGA - OREB + TOV + 0.4 * FTA$ <br/>
A more technical of this formula replaced the OREB with something more complex: <br/>
$FGA - OREB/OREB + DDREB  * (FGA-FGM) * 1.07+ TOV + 0.4 * FTA$ <br/>
It’s easy to calculate how efficient the two teams were with their possessions. An efficient offensive team scores more points with its given possessions, not more points overall.
_offensive rating_ --> points scored per 100 possessions
_defensive rating_ --> point allowed per 100 posesisons 
Thinking in terms of possessions and efficiency is the biggest thing that comes out of scoring a game with the score sheet above (Throughout the rest of this book, when a team offense is referred to as good, it is because they are efficient, not because they score a lot of points).
_Points per possession_ can expand thids concept to be applicable to individual players.

### The Best Offenses and Defenses (And some of the worst too)

No one cares about what make an average team. Anyone can be average (2.0 GPA .500 record, etc.)
Average is boring but you need to know what average is in order to define greatness and to define what is really bad. <br/>
The point in looking at great teams is to find consistencies amoung those temas, patterns that may suggest how to construct other team or how to predict what teams might be great. 
<br/>
_Were the star driven or system driven_
<br>
do team revolve arpund some unique offensive system or did the presence of a certain star player(s) casue them th reach greatness? --> More the talent than the system. The systems catered to the talents. <br/>
<ins>Floor percentage</ins> is the percentage of a team’s possessions in which the team
scores at least one point. Basically, floor percentage answers the question, “What
percentage of a team’s times down the floor does it score?” A possession in which
a team scores at least one point is known as a <ins>scoring possession</ins> <br/>
$floor percentage = scoring possessions / total possessions$ 
<ins>Field percentage</ins> is the percentage of a team’s non-foul shot possessions in
which the team scores a field goal. This value gets at the question: “If we assume
no foul will be called what chance does this team have to score from the field including
the possibility of offensive rebounds and turnovers?”
<ins>Play percentage</ins> is the percentage of a team’s “plays” on which the team
scores at least one point. (Teams with high floor percentages and high offensive ratings score very well from two-point land. Teams with low floor percentages and high ratings get
their points from three-pointers.Teams with high field percentages are very efficient from the field. They don’t turn the ball over, they get offensive rebounds, and they shoot pretty well. teams that have relatively low field percentages and high offensive ratings probably are either making a high percentage of their three-pointers and/or getting to the line a lot)<br/>
Trends suggest that most offenses deemphasize centers and point guards might not be as vital either. However, there is a correlation between good passing teams and good offensive teams. Teams that have a higher percentage of their field goals accompanied by assists tend to be better offensively.
<br>
_coaches with great offenses_
When a team appears on this list of great offenses several times with the
same coach, it may not actually be a reflection of great coaching, but a bit of luck. However, when a coach builds great offenses on multiple teams, that is at least an indication that
the coach knows how to let great talent be a great system. More likely, the coach
has some skill that he is passing on to his players to contribute to their greatness.
_correlation between height and great offenses_
The great offensive teams were generally taller than average. The shortest team
was the 1982 Nuggets, which was also the fastest. Running probably did help this team create advantages that they didn’t get in a half-court offense where height might be more important.
<br>
_standard deviation_ --> a measure of how much teams usually deviated from the average
